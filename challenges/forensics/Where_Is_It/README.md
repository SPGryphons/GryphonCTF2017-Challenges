## Setup Guide

1. upload files



## Distribution

pcap file with network traffic
- suspicious.pcap

## Solution

1.	look through file and you will notice a bunch of tcp packets `86-122`
2.	you will notice that the last few bits is the message sent
3. 	piecing all the last bits in the packet returns the flag.

OR	

3.	instead of manually piecing, just follow TCP stream
